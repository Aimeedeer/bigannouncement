# The Big Announcement

An uncensorable website that delivers a single message,
authored by the individual with the deepest pockets
(the most ETH).

Developed during [HackFS 2020],
it is a minimal project that demonstrates
the integration of [Ethereum] and [IPFS] with the web.

We are keeping a brief [hacklog] of our daily work,
while also drafting a [blog post] about the experience
and what we are learning.
