# BigAnnouncement submission video script


## Introduction

B: Hi, I'm Brian.

A: I'm Aimee.

B: We made a project called "The Big Announcement"

A: We're new to distributed application development,
and are interested in building distributed publishing platforms.

B: This project is a prototype designed to teach us,
and others,
the basics of distributed app development with web3.js and js-ipfs.

A: In this video we'll give a quick demonstration
of this simple project.


## About The Big Announcement

B: The Big Announcement is designed to be the smallest distributed
application possible that

1) uses web3.js
2) stores data to IPFS
3) locates data using Unstoppable Domains and the Ethereum Name Service
4) has no centralized dependencies

A: It is a media platform that displays a single very important message.

B: And, any person in the world may replace that message by
bidding more Ether than paid for the previous message.

A: That's the whole thing: pay the most,
display your message to the universe.

B: Let's give it a try.


## Demo



## Future work

B: The Big Announcement isn't itself much of a product,
but more of a teaching tool.

B: We are going to polish the tiny code base such that
it can be used as an example for beginner D-App developers.

A: We are also going to be blogging about our experience
building this project.
