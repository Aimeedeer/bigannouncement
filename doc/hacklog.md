## 2020/07/06

First day of HackFS.

There were some workshops last week,
some of which we attended.

Our objective is to learn how to write an Ethereum DApp,
that writes to IPFS storage,
and does not depend on a dedicated server.

Last week we brainstormed project ideas

We created an MVP roadmap,
with intentionally simple scope,
and prototyped the UI,
currently deployed to

We intend to write a blog post about the experience,
and [began outlining it][blogpost].
